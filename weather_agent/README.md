# Weather Agent: Your Personal Meteorologist

Welcome to the Weather Agent! This is a specialized agent that's part of our multi-agent trip planner.

## What It Does

The Weather Agent's job is to get the weather forecast for your destination. When you ask the main Host Agent for the weather, it will delegate the task to this agent.

## How to Run This Agent

This agent is designed to be run as part of the complete multi-agent system. For full instructions on how to get everything up and running, please see the main [README.md](../../README.md) file in the project's root directory.
