# Calendar Agent: Your Scheduling Assistant

Welcome to the Calendar Agent! This is a specialized agent that's part of our multi-agent trip planner.

## What It Does

The Calendar Agent's job is to connect to your Google Calendar and check your availability for your trip. When you ask the main Host Agent to check your calendar, it will delegate the task to this agent.

## How to Run This Agent

This agent is designed to be run as part of the complete multi-agent system. For full instructions on how to get everything up and running, please see the main [README.md](../../README.md) file in the project's root directory.
