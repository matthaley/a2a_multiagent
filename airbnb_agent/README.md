# Airbnb Agent: Your Accommodation Specialist

Welcome to the Airbnb Agent! This is a specialized agent that's part of our multi-agent trip planner.

## What It Does

The Airbnb Agent's job is to help you find the perfect place to stay for your trip. When you ask the main Host Agent to find an Airbnb, it will delegate the task to this agent.

## How to Run This Agent

This agent is designed to be run as part of the complete multi-agent system. For full instructions on how to get everything up and running, please see the main [README.md](../../README.md) file in the project's root directory.
