# Horizon Agent: Your Secure Order Specialist

Welcome to the Horizon Agent! This is a specialized, secure agent that's part of our multi-agent trip planner.

## What It Does

The Horizon Agent's job is to provide information about orders. This agent is a sample of a "tenant-specific" service, meaning it's designed to handle data for a particular user or company.

Because it handles sensitive information, this agent is secure and requires you to log in before you can use it.

## How to Run This Agent

This agent is designed to be run as part of the complete multi-agent system. For full instructions on how to get everything up and running, please see the main [README.md](../../README.md) file in the project's root directory.
